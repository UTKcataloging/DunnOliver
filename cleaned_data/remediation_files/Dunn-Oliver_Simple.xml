        <abstract>The first memoir is a handwritten account of the history of Cades Cove from its settlement in 1818 to the early 1900s, when the journal was written. The history mostly follows the Oliver Family, which are the ancestors of John W. Oliver, the writer of the journal. The journal deals with the genealogy of the Olivers in Cades Cove and of some of the other prominent families of the area, such as the Cables, the Tiptons, and the Burchfields. The author goes into personal accounts of his childhood in the Cove up through his adulthood. He also talks about his sons and their professions.</abstract>
